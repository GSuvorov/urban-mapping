# Urban Mapping demo project

Introduction
-------------
Now it's possible to digitize all buildings in the World using Computer vision and Satellite imagery. This project is started to help accelerate the routine work of digitizing of the buildings and to fill the data gaps in Openstreetmap's open data.  

## Ongoing progress
Our first target domain is Russian territory. We are going to update information on the dataset coverage and to provide some metrics on the comparison with OSM data. At the beginning it contains more than 36,5 mln buildings.

## Emergency Mapping contribution
The data is used fro Emergency Mapping response like in [Irkutsk region, Russia, that was heavily flooded in summer 2019](https://geoalert.github.io/Irkutsk-flood/) - so we will appreciate any related contribution and data requests.

Please check for the issues or contact us directly at [hello@geoalert.io](mailto:hello@geoalert.io)

The input data is copyrighted by data providers but is not distributed along with the dataset. In Mapbox Terms of Service it's stated clear that 
```You may use Studio or third-party software to trace Mapbox maps solely comprised of satellite imagery ("Mapbox Satellite Imagery") and produce derivative vector datasets for non-commercial purposes and for OpenStreetMap. (https://www.mapbox.com/legal/tos/#[YmuSEapb)```

## Dataset details
* Coordinate reference system - EPSG: 4326
